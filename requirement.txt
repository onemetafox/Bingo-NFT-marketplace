are we able to do the code to the customer can send the NFT to ther own wallet and not have it locked into the site please

so i want to be able to sent NFT to my wallet basicly

also we need a delayed period so we can cheek images for copy right before they go live, so we dont get sued  
remember NFT is free to mint on our site (except network fees) payouts are doneon successful the sales 
we decided on 70/30 ratio 
30%  to us and 70%remaining to artist 

so if the sale of an NFT s 1 eth we would get 30% and the creator or user will get 70%
separate thing can you create a code that can tell if the image has been copied so it runs it through the internet to check for copy rights  
remember we want the consumer in control thats our sells pitch

also when a customer create a NFT and it cost $1 in gas fees for example in avax can we set it so it charges an additional 20%  so we would get 20 cent in a maintenance wallet
Luke did this in his smart contract 
so we make 20% on gas fees as we dont make any money untill the sale

Briefly read this and let me know if you have any question.
going to bed now, leave msg here
